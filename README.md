I hate coding so much that opening an IDE feels like torture, so I spend <br>
work hours writing this README, thinking I’m the coolest developer on the earth. <br>
Tried to fix one thing last week, over-engineered it to death, <br>
and now I want nothing to do with code.

**Rust sounds better anyway**.

You’ve probably met me on a Rust server, <br>
desperately overcomplicating every raid while slowly dying of hunger.

Dude, do you really think I'm going to brag about my code?
